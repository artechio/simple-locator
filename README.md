# Simple Locator for WordPress


## Overview

Simple locator is ideal for developers who are looking for a way to implement location search for any post type within WordPress. Simple locator is different in that it allows the selection of any existing custom fields for use as the geocoded data sources. If there are no existing data sources, the plugin ships with a "location" post type with fields ready to go.

Best suited for WordPress developers looking for a customizable way of adding location search.
